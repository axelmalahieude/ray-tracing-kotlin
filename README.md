# Kotlin Ray Tracing
Ray tracing application made in Kotlin

Goal is to be able to create a scene with one or more spheres on a surface, and render an image using ray tracing.

**Current progress**: the app is able to generate an image of a sphere by tracing the shadow ray to the light source and applying Lambertian reflectance. 
See examples in `images/`

**Current to-dos**:
- Trace the reflected ray
- Create surface under spheres
- Eventually add linear transformations to make scene building easier

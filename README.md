# Kotlin Ray Tracing
Ray tracing application made in Kotlin, created out of interest in computer graphics and to learn about ray tracing

Goal is to be able to create a scene with various shapes on a surface, and render an image of the scene using ray tracing.

**Current progress**: the app is able to generate an image of a sphere by tracing the shadow ray to the light source 
and applying Lambertian reflectance. 
See examples in `images/`

**Current to-dos**:
- Trace the reflected ray
- Create surface under spheres
- Eventually add linear transformations to make scene building easier
- Implement Phong Shading

**Completed to-dos**:
- Consolidate coordinate and vector classes
- Added some linear transformations to help with placing the camera
